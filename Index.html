            <h2>System Architecture</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Our Brick Breaker game is built on a robust architecture that integrates various hardware and software components. Below is a block diagram and a detailed explanation of how each component is connected:</p>
            <p>Here is how each component is interconnected:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>CC3200 Microcontroller and OLED:</strong> Connected via SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface), allowing high-speed data transfer for display updates.</li>
                <li><strong>CC3200 Microcontroller and AWS:</strong> Connected through REST API/WiFi, enabling seamless data transmission to and from the cloud for real-time score tracking.</li>
                <li><strong>CC3200 Microcontroller and Accelerometer:</strong> Linked via I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit), facilitating accurate readings of tilt and motion for game control.</li>
                <li><strong>CC3200 Microcontroller and IR Receiver:</strong> Connected using the NEC protocol, which is widely used for remote control systems, ensuring reliable communication.</li>
                <li><strong>IR Receiver and IR Remote:</strong> Communicate through IR waves, allowing the user to interact with the game via the remote control.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Functional Specification</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Our overarching system structure is based off a state machine, with the playable game itself being one of the controllers taking one state to the next. Each one of the entrance screens represents a state, where the player can either <br>
                a: Select a new player (and proceed to IO substates, and then to the game), or <br>
                b: Select an existing player (and proceed to player selection, and then to the game) <br>
                In either case, before the end of player configuration the code sends an HTTP GET request to the Shadow to get information on existing scores and players. Once these steps are finished, the game is played through and the accumulated information is <i>then</i> sent to the Shadow to minimize the time-costly step of internet connectivity.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Functional Blocks</h2>
            <hr>
            <div>
                <h3>AWS Integration</h3>
                <p>The game leverages AWS for robust cloud storage and data handling. We configure AWS to manage player profiles and game scores, ensuring data persistence across sessions. AWS is set up to trigger updates whenever a player achieves a new high score, which is then stored and can be retrieved in real time for leaderboard updates.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>OLED Display via SPI</h3>
                <p>The OLED display is crucial for real-time game feedback. Connected via SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface), it offers high-speed data transmission allowing for quick updates on the screen. This setup displays game scores, player profiles, and other critical game information dynamically as the game progresses.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Accelerometer via I2C</h3>
                <p>The accelerometer is integral to the game's control mechanism. It captures the tilt and motion of the CC3200 board via I2C protocol, translating physical movements into game actions. This allows players to control the paddle in the game by physically tilting the board, providing an immersive gaming experience.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>IR Communication</h3>
                <p>The IR receiver and remote communicate using IR waves, allowing for remote game controls. This setup enables players to make selections on the game's menu and other interfaces without direct contact with the board, enhancing the usability and accessibility of the game.</p>

            <h2>Technical Challenges</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Throughout the development of our Brick Breaker game on the CC3200 microcontroller, we encountered several technical challenges that required innovative solutions. One of the main hurdles was managing the limited memory and processing power of the CC3200 while ensuring smooth gameplay and real-time data processing. Implementing efficient memory management techniques was crucial to avoid performance bottlenecks.</p>
            <p>Additionally, establishing a stable and secure connection between the microcontroller and AWS posed challenges, particularly in handling the REST API calls over WiFi. Ensuring reliable data transmission without loss or corruption was paramount, especially when updating high scores and player data in real-time. We also faced complexities in calibrating the accelerometer accurately to translate physical tilts into precise in-game movements, which was critical for the intuitive gameplay experience our game offers.</p>
            <p>Integrating the IR communication system required careful tuning to prevent interference and ensure that signals from the IR remote were decoded accurately by the IR receiver. Each of these challenges was addressed through rigorous testing and iterative development, allowing us to refine our system and deliver a seamless gaming experience.</p>
